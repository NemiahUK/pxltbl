# Pixel Table - Alpha

![alt text](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dqb8gqKWsAAfOK3.jpg:large "Pixel Table")


The API comes with a browser-based Emulator so you don’t need to build the table just yet.

## Try it out now - no hardware required!

You can now run the web-based emulator from any machine: Windows, Linux, Mac or RasPi. Follow the quick start guide and create 
progs that will run on a physical Pixel Table and play with them using a virtual Pixel Table in your browser.

## BIG plans

It's early days yet, but we have lots of great ideas. You can build "progs" using your web browser right now, then when we 
release the full build guid you can build your own table. 

## Hardware guide coming soon

We'll also be releasing a full guide on how to build your own Pixel Table using a RasPi + Arduino + NeoPixels. It's fairly straight
forward, and once built, you can use this API to make programming your table super-easy!
